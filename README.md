# pricing-Asian-options
This project try to price an arithmetic Asian option using Binomial tree method and have a comparison with the price of an European options using Black Schole method  


Asian options is well-known as exotic options that have more flexible features compare to plain vanilla options like European options.
There are several pricing methodologies to price Asian options. This report aims to present the Asian option pricing methodology in discrete time, the binomial tree model. 
Using BTM and modified BTM, we will show the numerical results and some sensitivity analysis. While the computational cost of standard BTM is very high, leading to low efficiency, the modified BTM need to be careful with number of representative average prices in order to deduce the correct option values.
We also compare the pros and cons of Asian options over plain vanilla options to persuade both exchanges and investors to enter this market. Lastly, we will discuss the mitigation of the risk of price jump of cryto-currencies.
